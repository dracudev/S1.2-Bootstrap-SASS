## üìê Project Structure

### Level 1

- **Exercise 1**: Implement the main content with a fixed navigation bar using Bootstrap's `NavBar` component. Use the `Grid Responsive` system to divide the screen into two columns (slogan and image). Modify Bootstrap's primary and secondary colors using SASS.
  
- **Exercise 2**: Create the "Features" section using Bootstrap's `Grid` and `Tabs` components. Customize the tabs to match the design.

- **Exercise 3**: Build the download section. You can either customize Bootstrap's `Cards` or create your own classes to replicate the design.

- **Exercise 4**: Implement the FAQs section using Bootstrap's `Accordion` component. Customize the accordion classes to fit the provided layout.

### Level 2

- **Exercise 5**: Build the footer with a Bootstrap form that includes validation. Show error messages if the newsletter form is empty or the email format is incorrect.

### Level 3

- **Exercise 6**: Modify the hover states of buttons, links, tabs, and alerts to reflect the design specifications.
